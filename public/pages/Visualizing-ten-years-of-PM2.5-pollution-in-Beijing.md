Air quality, as part of environmental amenities, is related not only to health but also community quality and individual satisfaction. It is widely acknowledged to be an indicator of the quality of urban life and further links to the profiles of ‘competitive city’, ‘urban sustainability’, etc. Unfortunately, the air quality in Beijing, the capital city of China and an emerging node in the global city system, has been red-flagged in recent decade and caught the world’s attention. This work aims to explore the day-to-day trend in PM2.5 pollution in Beijing over the past decade. The experience of Beijing can be a reference for cities in the developing world that may face the same challenge of reconciling development and environmental protection in an era of global urbanization.

 

The data is visualized in a calendar view with colors representing the daily average PM2.5 concentration. The color scale is based on the sky color under the pollution level. The calendar view can be more informative than point plots, since it is able to communicate patterns and trends on multiple temporal scales (days, weeks, seasons, years) simultaneously.
