Socio-spatial differentiation has been identified not only in capitalist market economies but also in transitional countries, including post-reform China. However, most prior studies on this topic in Chinese cities are limited to a spatial resolution of the sub-district level, and finer scale analyses remain scarce. This work provides a block-level examination of the socio-spatial dynamics in the central city of Beijing by employing the Beijing Travel Survey data which contain rich socio-economic information. Latent class analysis and GIS visualization are used to stratify the residents into different levels of socio-economic well-being based on multiple attributes and analyze their spatial distribution. The findings reveal a dramatic transformation of the socio-spatial landscape in Beijing in only five years between 2005 and 2010, 90% blocks show a greater than 10% increase or decrease in the average social strata index of their residents. The socio-spatial dynamics can to a large extent be related to the market reform of Chinaâ€™s economy and housing distribution, which exerts the influence through not only commercial developments but also profound interactions with the public sector.
