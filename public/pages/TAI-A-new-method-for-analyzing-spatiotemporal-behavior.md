Time is a fundamental characteristic in understanding human spatiotemporal behavior. However, the spatial aspect has been studied in much more detail than the temporal aspect. For example, when investigating the temporal pattern of activities, many existing studies would simplify and treat the time of activity as one temporal point. This work propose a new method to understand the temporal pattern of human activities by plotting activity points on a two-dimensional plane using the start time and end time as the axes and analyzing the point pattern with GIS methods. We also propose a new concept, Temporal Areas of Interest (TAI), defined as the area on the plane of start time and end time where activity points are densely distributed and therefore worths attention/interest. The idea and method is applied to a weekâ€™s metro smart card data in Shanghai. The results show the basic rhythm of human activities in the city and also reveal some facts that are unexpected or ignored before, such as a large number of overtime work or similar activities on evenings and weekends. We think that the proposed method can provide a new perspective in evaluating urban activity patterns and how the city functions.
