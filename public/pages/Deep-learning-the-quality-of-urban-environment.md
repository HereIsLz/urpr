The combination of machine learning models and street view images has opened a new window to investigate cities for urban researchers. In this work, we dealt with the difficulty of evaluating the quality of urban environment in fine-grain and in large-scale for modern cities, the size of which is beyond the perceptual capacity of most people. Correspondingly, it is also difficult to accurately answer questions such as ‘where the quality of the physical environment is the most declined in the city and resources should be allocated for regeneration’ and ‘in fast urbanizing and changing cities, how is the quality of urban environment’. We developed a series of computer vision models for this task by leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and wide-coverage street view images. From various physical qualities that have been identified by previous research to be important for urban experience, we choose two key qualities, the construction and maintenance quality of buildings and the continuity of buildings. We show that the machine learning models can produce a medium-to-good estimation of people's real experience, and the modelling results can be applied in many ways by researchers, decision-makers and local residents.
