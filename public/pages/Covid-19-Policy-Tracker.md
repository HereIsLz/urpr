As Covid-19 goes on, dozens of repositories are being curated to gather the public health and social measures (PHSMs) implemented by the governments around the globe to stop the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (see Oxford Supertracker). These policy repositories can assist researchers and policy-makers to better evaluate the measures taken in the past and devise better measures for the future. Yet, given the volume of these policies, most existing repositories focus on the national level, while policies made by states/provinces and lower-level authorities are far from complete, which can vary a lot and significantly impact the numbers of infections across administrative divisions.

This project aims to fill in this gap by providing a full record of state/provincial-level (or equivalent first-level subdivisions) PHSMs in eight countries: China, Japan, Korea, Russia, UK, Germany, US and Brazil, which cover different continents and approaches towards Covid-19. The data set presents all the state/provincial-level policies in each country from the outbreak of Covid-19 up to Aug 15, 2020.
