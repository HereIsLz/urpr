Chinese rural life through mobile phone data

How is daily life like in rural China nowadays? Where do the rural residents work and where do they go shopping and spend their leisure time? How far do they need to travel for work and maintenance? … The answers are not fully clear to researchers and policy-makers as rural China undergoes drastic changes both spatially and socially in the process of urbanization. In order to re-establish an understanding of daily rural life in China, we employ the mobile phone data, which has been extensively applied in urban studies but rarely in the rural contexts. 

We used the prefecture of Chengdu in west China as the case of study. From a week’s mobile phone trace data provided by China Unicom, we identified 0.97 million rural residents (17% of the rural population by official statistics) and studied their daily activity patterns, including the home-work locations pairs, the number and spatial range of movements per day, the diversity of destinations, etc. For example, we found that 7% of all rural labor forces in Chengdu commute to urban areas to conduct non-agricultural work, which is an unconventional lifestyle.

We also further examined the impact of a major rural policy in China, namely rural housing land consolidation, which is a policy to relocate rural residents, reduce the area of built-up land and reclaim agricultural land. This policy has been widely implemented across China since 2005, yet the impact on the daily life of rural people is seldom quantitatively evaluated. We filled this gap by examining the daily activity pattern of rural residents in consolidated and unconsolidated villages and found that housing land consolidation results in longer distance to work, 375 meters in average, and shorter distance for non-work activities, 529 meters in average.
